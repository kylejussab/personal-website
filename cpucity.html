            <p>CPU City follows the journey of 
                <span class="highlighted-text">Rhi Vyse</span>, a determined teenager living in a vibrant city powered by technology. When the mysterious 
                <span class="highlighted-text">Pro-Krastor Nation</span> begins to sabotage the city's systems, Rhi must step up to stop their plans by navigating the city to uncover its secrets; the 
                <span class="highlighted-text">Von Neumann Architecture</span> that keeps it running. The educational adventure 
                <span class="highlighted-text">teaches computing concepts</span> through a hero-driven narrative set in a colorful, fun, and engaging world.

    <div class="game-sub-overview">
        <div class="content">
            <h4 class="content-heading">Why?</h4>
            <p>The idea for CPU City came from a collaboration between myself and teammate 
                <span class="highlighted-text">Jess</span>, a GCSE Computer Science teacher. While I was passionate about 
                <span class="highlighted-text">edutainment</span>, Jess brought deep insight into the classroom struggles students faced. 
                Together, we saw an opportunity to turn difficult concepts into something 
                <span class="highlighted-text">playful, accessible, and fun</span>. 
                Jess also provided direct access to our target audience, allowing for meaningful playtesting throughout development.
            </p>
            <p>
                We envisioned our game as a long-term project; a gamified city where each level teaches a different part of the 
                <span class="highlighted-text">GCSE Computer Science syllabus</span>. 
                For this version, we focused on a single level covering the 
                <span class="highlighted-text">Von Neumann Architecture</span>, one of the first topics students encounter. 
                This choice allowed us to illustrate the game's full potential while keeping the project scoped and achievable.

        <h2>The feel of modern gaming</h2>

        <div class="game-sub-block">
            <p class="block-heading">Quests and combat.</p>
            <div>
                <p>It was important to make this feel like a game you would play in 2024 and try to disguise the education part as much as possible because we believe education can be done passively and implicitly while having fun. I built both the quest and combat systems from the ground up to achieve this.</p>
                <p>The quest system works in harmony with the dialogue system. Game objects are tagged as “quest givers,” and quests are assigned only if their index is one higher than the player’s current quest. This keeps the game linear and makes sure the player goes through a guided path while still being allowed to explore.</p>
                <p>For combat, I developed a straightforward system that leverages basic enemy AI, utilizing state machines to transition between “idle,” “pursuing,” and “attacking” states. The AI follows the player using navigation meshes but is designed to be more irritating than intelligent, focusing on creating a challenging experience rather than sophisticated tactics.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="game-sub-block">
            <p class="block-heading">The interconnected systems.</p>
            <div>
                <p>The world is designed to be visually engaging and filled with distractions, encouraging exploration and interaction with various collectible objects. This is balanced by a strict 10-minute time limit and a scoring system that rewards quick decision-making while penalizing distractions. The scoring system fosters friendly competition, making it ideal for classroom settings where students can replay the game to improve their scores. This replayability reinforces the educational content, helping students absorb key concepts more effectively.</p>
                <p>The hydration system serves as a reminder of the importance of staying hydrated in real life. In-game, a lack of hydration restricts Rhi’s abilities, such as sprinting and using his attack fireball. Players must seek out water droplets to maintain hydration levels. Achieving high scores requires maintaining consistent hydration throughout the gameplay. This blend of collectible items, engaging world elements, and the added pressure of a time limit creates a dynamic and enjoyable balancing act, making the educational experience both fun and effective.</p>

        <h2>Edutainment done right</h2>

        <div class="game-sub-block">
            <p class="block-heading">Video game first, education second.</p>
            <div>
                <p>Our primary goal was to create a captivating video game experience that seamlessly integrates educational content without compromising on fun. By focusing on making the game engaging and enjoyable first, we ensured that learning became an inherent part of the gameplay rather than the primary focus.</p>
                <p>The game’s design emphasizes exploration and interaction, with a vibrant city setting that naturally draws players in. This approach allows educational elements to be embedded subtly within the gameplay mechanics. For example, the Von Neumann Architecture is represented through intuitive game systems and challenges, making complex concepts more accessible through interactive experiences.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Achieving the right balance between challenge and accessibility was crucial to creating an inclusive and engaging experience for all players. We aimed to ensure that the game is enjoyable and educational for a wide range of skill levels, from newcomers to seasoned gamers.</p>
                <p>To make the game accessible, we designed intuitive controls and user-friendly interfaces that facilitate easy navigation and interaction. Players can quickly grasp the mechanics and start enjoying the gameplay without a steep learning curve. The quest system and gameplay objectives are structured to be straightforward, allowing players to focus on the fun aspects of exploration and interaction.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the educational components are integrated in a way that complements the gameplay rather than dominating it. This approach allows players to learn passively through their interactions and achievements, making the game accessible to those who might be hesitant about traditional educational tools.</p>
