        <h2>Getting the bigger picture</h2>

            <p class="block-heading">Make no assumptions.</p>
            <div>
                <p>It was important to include as many factors into this analysis as possible, and one of the most important one I felt was needed, was user reviews. The data collected was scraped from platforms like Metacritic and it must be stated that I personally didn't do the scrapping, I used the data found from another exploratory analysis.</p>
                <p>I processed and cleaned this data with Pandas, ensuring its integrity by handling missing values, normalizing formats, and removing duplicates. Regular expressions and natural language processing (NLP) techniques from the NLTK library were utilized to preprocess textual data for sentiment analysis.</p>
                <p>For sentiment analysis, I developed a model using NLTK and TextBlob to analyze user reviews, identifying key themes and sentiments. Custom algorithms were added to detect nuanced sentiments specific to the game's narrative and gameplay. Comparative analysis was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that illustrated the game's performance relative to other industry titles while also acknowledging its PlayStation exclusivity.</p>

        <h2>Good or bad?</h2>

        <div class="game-sub-block">
            <p class="block-heading">... and the reasons why.</p>
            <div>
                <p>A significant majority, 62%, of user reviews falling into the extremes of scores 0 or 10, there is a clear tendency toward polarized opinions. On average, users seem to either regard it as the best game ever or the worst game ever.</p>
                <p>The sentiment is more positive than negative, indicated by a slight rightward shift in polarity scores. High subjectivity scores suggest a bias towards opinions rather than objective information. However, some negative reviews use polite language, which inflates their sentiment scores towards the positive. While broad insights are evident, this nuance highlights the complexity of sentiment analysis. Despite this, the data indicates that more users expressed favorable opinions about the game than negative ones.</p>
                <p>The word cloud analysis highlights intriguing patterns, with terms like "character," "game," "story," and "Ellie" common in both positive and negative reviews, suggesting a divisive narrative. "Joel" appears more frequently in negative reviews, reflecting his beloved status from the first game and the controversy over his death in the sequel. Conversely, "Abby" appears more in positive reviews, indicating some users appreciated her role. The analysis suggests that dissatisfaction often stems from Joel's death rather than Abby being the perpetrator, with Joel's death being central to the game's storyline.</p>

        <div class="game-sub-block">
            <p class="block-heading">Commercial success?</p>
            <div>
                <p>The sales data for The Last of Us on PS3 show approximately 6.27 million units sold. However, considering its PS4 remaster, the game has sold over 17 million units. Comparatively, Red Dead Redemption 2, another single-platform sequel, achieved 13.94 million sales. Historically, the first Red Dead Redemption sold 6.57 million copies, with its sequel surpassing this by 7.37 million units. While precise figures for The Last of Us Part II are unavailable, it has outsold its predecessor by over 3.8 million units, positioning it as a significant success, though it has not matched the sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 despite their similar nature. The Last of Us Part II is a success, ranking among the best-selling titles on its platform. However, it did not surpass the original game's acclaim or sales, falling short of the nearly 14 million units sold by Red Dead Redemption 2. While successful, The Last of Us Part II did not achieve its full potential in sales.</p>
                <p>The Last of Us Part II, despite having a similar budget to other successful games like God of War, didn't achieve comparable profits. With over 15 million copies sold, God of War outperformed The Last of Us Part II, highlighting its underperformance in budget and profit terms. This shortfall is likely due to the game's divisive reception, marked by negative reviews and the impactful leak of Joel's death, which hindered its potential growth and sales.</p>
                <p>Despite its sales figures, The Last of Us Part II was the most awarded video game for a significant time, winning 322 awards before being surpassed by Elden Ring. It outperformed games like God of War and Red Dead Redemption 2 in terms of critical acclaim, suggesting that user reception significantly impacted its sales performance. This disparity highlights that sales and critical reception do not always align, underscoring a distinction between the two aspects.</p>
