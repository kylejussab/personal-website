                    <p>An application made to explore creative ways of visualizing music, and giving users an appealing way of looking at waveforms in many conventional and unconventional ways.</p>

                    <h3>Retrospective</h3>
                    <p>This project allowed me to explore creative solutions to problems. Though I don’t think I did everything as well as I could have, I appreciate the unintentional lessons coding this project taught me. This could be considered "creative coding"—it was exploratory, with a feature-first, code-later approach. That is a very fun and freeing way to build an application, but it also helps to think about the code ahead of time and plan the features more rigorously first. The only visualizer I’m really proud of is the ‘Trap Nation’ clone, which is understandable in hindsight because that’s the one I spent the most time on.</p>

            <div>
                <p>In creating this music visualizer application, I had two primary objectives in mind. First, I aimed for it to have a sleek, music-player-like appearance, reminiscent of platforms like Spotify. I wanted it to look and feel like a natural extension, something that could easily be integrated as a feature.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I placed a strong emphasis on customizability. I wanted users to have the freedom to personalize their visualizations, allowing them to make it uniquely their own. Each visualization comes with a range of customizable features.</p>
                <p>Overall, the application was designed to strike a balance between practicality and aesthetics, ensuring it could seamlessly blend in with well-known music platforms like Spotify or Apple Music, rather than appearing overly complex. If I achieved my goals, the application shouldn’t look trivial.</p>
