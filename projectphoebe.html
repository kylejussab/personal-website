        <p>
          In the Unity Junior Pathway, I was tasked to build my own project as I
          learnt how to develop games in Unity. The projects used in the pathway
          were very simple games and I wanted to expand my game a little more
          than what was required. I added 5 different levels, all unique in
          their play style, and added general game state. This game requires a
          controller, and throughout its development I used a PlayStation
          controller, and even use PlayStation icons. I developed it on Mac, and
          I was unable to test the game on Windows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having improved my Unity skills since this project, it now holds a
          special place in my heart, even though I know I can create something
          much greater today. I remember the struggles and the vision I had for
          it, along with the knowledge I lacked at the time. Despite this,
          completing the project and learning entirely on my own outside of my
          studies is something I find truly impressive. Unity used to seem like
          a daunting tool that appeared very complicated, but now it's a
          familiar place, and this project was the beginning of that journey.
          For my first Unity game, it's not a bad 'first' at all. Reflecting on
          this experience, I realize how important 'first' projects like these
          are for learning and growth.

          I never intended for this game to have a sphere as its playable
          character, but creating a full human character with animations was
          beyond my capabilities at the time. Initially, this was demotivating,
          but it provided me with a realistic and achievable goal: learning all
          the fundamentals necessary to develop the third-person experiences I
          aspire to create in the future. This project also gave me the chance
          to explore adding puzzle mechanics into a 3D space. Although I
          implemented these mechanics inefficiently with two arrays and multiple
          if-else statements, they functioned exactly as intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working on this game allowed me to improve essential skills, such as
          coding camera mechanics, integrating controller support, designing a
          main menu, and implementing a checkpoint system. These are features
          common to many games, and mastering them will enhance my abilities in
          future projects. Through this iterative process, I gained valuable
          experience and confidence, turning initial setbacks into opportunities
          for growth.

          I wanted a game that was minimal enough for me to just worry about the
          programming. I dabbled in some 3d asset building but quickly lost
          sight of the full project. This project was meant to be as simple as
          possible yet feel like more than a demonstration. This is why I ended
          up building 5 different modes that are all played in a different way,
          with different systems for each.
        </p>
        <p>
          As stated in my Game Development Journal (that can be found below)
          during the process of developing this game, I found the methods I used
          for all my systems could’ve been approached in a better way. One that
          I will specifically pick out is the sequential puzzle system, which
          remembers the order in which pressure plates were activated. I used a
          binary array that was the same length as the number of plates in the
          puzzle. When a plate was activated in the right order it would change
          a 0 in the array to a 1. Once the order was incorrect the entire array
          was reset to all 0s. Though this system works, I felt that using an
          array was the wrong data structure for this type of system, as it had
          no information on the plates, just the order in which they needed to
          be activated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, all the code I typed was made as modular as possible, which
          allowed me to easily make multiple modes. If needed, I could easily
          incorporate any of the systems in the individual levels into one
          single level. It was very important that I had menus and that the game
          was played with a controller. Up till this point I had never made a
          game with either, I wanted to push myself to learn as much as I
          possibly could during development. I’ll never be a good game
          programmer if I only stick to what I know. To make better games I need
          to be a more versatile programmer, and this is just the start of that
          process!
