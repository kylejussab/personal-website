                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The player finds themselves in a dystopian world where extreme wealth and poverty have torn society. Players play as Elian Cross, the protagonist who is amongst the poor Rusthaveners and becomes a symbol of hope and change in this divided world. The game is divided into two interconnected societies — Auravale and Rusthaven in which the player assumes a pivotal role in each society every time they die.</p>
                    <p>In Rusthaven Elian leads a rebellion against the oppressive wealthy elite with minimal resources stealth and wit. In Auravale Elian becomes part of the rich, facing the consequences of the actions made from the wealthy while fighting off the rebellion with an abundance of resources. The two narratives are linked and Elian develops relationships with characters on both sides, where all actions in one society translate to the other.</p>

        <div class="game-sub-block">
            <p class="block-heading">Duality.</p>
            <div>
                <p>What really intrigues me is "villain" stories. Our view of any character is framed by the view we see though the protagonist. So what if we have a story where there is clear battle between two sides, a clear distain from both sides, but we play and see both sides of this story. Better yet what if the protagonist stays the same on both sides.</p>
                <p>The idea behind the death mechanic is to not only offer different types of gameplay, but to "de-villainize" and "de-heroize" any characters. Part of that is making your "hero" be your "villain" simultaneously. This battle in the physical world and within Elian is the intriguing bit with the goal of making the player as morally conflicted as possible. Good is bad and bad is good.</p>
                <p>The goal is to get to the inevitable final meeting and letting the player decide how to proceed. After experiencing both stories and empathizing for both, is the choice still that easy? </p>
